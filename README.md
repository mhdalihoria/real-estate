# Real Estate Test:

  

### Here is some notes to take in consideration while reviewing this project:

  

1- Database:

- The database (mockDB.js) contains the data for the following:

  - email/password - information about properties - and information about the "more homes" section, etc.

- Since the data I have created has the same amount of rooms and location names, I have decided to not use these parameters in the filtration process, but they are there as UI elements. So please take that in consideration while testing the app.

  

2- Google Map API:

- Due to the API being a paid service, I was unable to create a 1-to-1 "clone" shown in the design files.

- The coordinates of the random location generated by each refreshed is shared among "Rent" page as well as "Info" page via Context API, thought I suppose it is a bit difficult to check that due to the annoying pop up that Google creates.

  

3- Reasons for URL of "Info" page:

- As a developer it is extremely vital to be able to handle API requests and generate URLs accordingly. With that being said, I had mimicked the type of URLs a developer would create when dynamically creating pages when consuming APIs (or RESTful APIs).

  

4- Notes on the filtration process:

- It doesn't matter if the user navigated to the "Rent" page right away to use the form there, or used the one that exists in "Home", the results of both options will be the same (provided that the query is the exact same), as the information about the data to be fetched is shared via Context API, between the two pages.
